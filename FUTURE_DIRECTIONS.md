# Future Directions

## 1. Slightly change the genome filtering methodology, to use the metric 'Complete BUSCO (%)' versus 'Single-copy BUSCO (%)', which is a more standard metric, and would allow for the addition of ~20 more genomes. The cutoff will still be 95%.

*Why do this?* 

1. In corporate more Peltigerales genomes. The *Lobraria* genomes (Peltigerales) which seem very different compared to all of the other lineages in the Lecanoromycetes.

2. Incorporate more genomes from the Pertusariaceae. It is currently just *Agyrium*, which makes comparsions difficult because it is unclear if the differences in orthogroup copy number are due to *Agyrium* being non-lichenized, or if this is a lineage difference.

**NEED TO CHECK IF OTHER LINEAGES ARE ALSO VERY UNDER-REPRESENTED AND SEE IF THERE IS A WAY TO INCORPORATE THESE**

## 2. Incorporate transcriptome (RNA-seq) information into the gene prediction and modeling

This has been shown to substantially impact the gene predictions and improves the capability to identify locations of introns and alternate splicing sites.

## 3. Incorpoorate genomes from the Eurotiomycetes and Lichinomycetes.

The Lecanoromyctes and Eurotiomycetes are sister clades. The L+E clade is sister to the Lichinomycetes. It is highly unclear the origins of lichenization within this triad. Notably, the Lichinomycetes represents a class of fungi that are almost entirelt symbiotic, as lichens, endophytes, and mycorrhizae.

## 4. Notes from discussion with Betsy Arnold

She is re-anlyzing some of her data to see if she has any cultures available from the Ostropales (and Stictidaceae). A main question from her: Are the Stictidaceae of endophytes? The answer seems to be mostly... No. Fungi of the Stictidaceae are mostly wood-decay saprotrophs. Is there anything weird about biosynthetic gene clusters, sugar metabolism, or otherwise that seems to be distinctly different based on the Stictidaceae growing on wood rather than another substrate?

## 5. Revisit lichenization in the Basidiomycota

*Lichenomphalia* is a lichenized genus within the basidiomycetes. It is a highly distinct, recent, and very likely independent lineage of lichenization. Rather than looking at losses of the lichenization, can we identify signatures associated with lichenization through a recent transition to the lichen-lifestyle?
